        From Berlin,Germany, Wanda von Bremen is a 25-year-old photographer focused on environmental issues and nature destruction. <br> After receiving her Bachelor of Science she worked as an ecologist in various places such as Costa Rica, Madagascar and Chile. <br>
         Influenced by these experiences Wanda started combining her conservation background with her artistic passion. She draws from these experiences to create whimsical pictures full of visceral elements. Her visual imagery gives space to the concept of interdependence. It emphasizes the diversity of nature and dispel the negative perception of earth’s mostly unseen elements.
  <br> Wanda believes in change, she is an active and curious person engaging with political movements and intercultural organizations.
