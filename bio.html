       Wanda von Bremen is a photographer, artist, and ecologist who is deeply dedicated to finding innovative communication strategies to raise awareness about the critical ecological issues facing our planet. With a Bachelor of Science in Nature Conservation and a degree in photography from the renowned International Center of Photography in New York, Wanda has successfully combined activism, ecology, and art to create a unique and impactful approach to a sustainable future.
Her work captures the beauty of interconnectivity and significance of often-overlooked organisms and creatures within our ecosystems, such as fungi, algae, and insects. She often focuses on the human-nature relationship and the relationship she has with nature. Wanda is currently pursuing her MA in Ecology Futures at St Joost School of Art and Design in the Netherlands, where she is exploring alternative realities from a well-informed perspective that considers the complexity of ecological issues and avoids oversimplification and one-sided approaches.
As an artist and design thinking coach, Wanda uses her skills to inspire others to imagine alternative futures and to design more innovative and effective solutions to complex problems through creative workshops. <br><br>

Her exhibitions include "Global Images for Global Crisis" at the ICP Museum in New York and "Nature through her Eyes" at Alliance Francaise in Cape Town. She has also taken part in residencies such as EV_Largo's Brazil "Possible Futures" and the "Environmental Photography" mentorship program from NATIVE Agency. In 2022, she explored sustainable art approaches at the "Estudio Abierto" residency in Oaxaca, Mexico, and participated in the La Wayaka residency at the Guna Yala indigenous territory in Panama.
As part of the Estudio Nuboso collective she participated in the "Suelo Methodology" for a project in Barranquilla, Colombia. Additionally, Wanda has been serving as a mentor at Fotofuturo since 2022, an online education platform that empowers female photographers and helps them launch their careers in photography.

        From Berlin, Germany, Wanda von Bremen is a 25-year-old photographer showing nature with all its details and beauty. <br> <br>  After receiving her Bachelor of Science she worked as an ecologist in various places such as Costa Rica, Madagascar and Chile. <br>
         Influenced by these experiences Wanda started combining her conservation background with her artistic passion. She draws from these experiences to create whimsical pictures full of visceral elements. Her visual imagery gives space to the concept of interdependence. It emphasizes the diversity of nature and dispel the negative perception of earth’s mostly unseen elements.
  <br> Wanda believes in change, she is an active and curious person engaging with political movements and intercultural organizations.
