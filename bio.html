			Originally from Berlin, Germany, Wanda von Bremen is a 25-year-old photographer focused on environmental issues and nature awareness. In 2018, she received a Bachelor of Science in Landscape Management and Nature Protection at the University of Sustainable Development Eberswalde. <br> In the past 6 years, she worked as an Ecology Researcher in various places such as the Costa Rican rainforest, the dry forest in Madagascar and Chiles part of Patagonia. Working in such remote places allowed her to study each ecosystem in its detail, its differences and its uniqueness in the world. Influenced by working in such remote places, Wanda started combining her conservation background with her artistic passion. As a result, she uses her fascination for details and interest in visceral material to create unique and whimsical pictures.<br>
Wanda is a curious and active person, she co-organized initiatives in Berlin and Santiago de Chile to support the youth by engaging with political decisions, as part of the Fridays for Future Movement.<br> <br> She has exhibited her work in “The Perfect Image” show at The Local NY Gallery in New York in 2019 and shot a campaign for the Generationen-Stiftung in Berlin in 2018. In March 2020 one of her photographs got mentioned in the New York Times Article “International Center of Photography wants your Images of the Pandemic”. She is enrolled in the New Media Narrative program at the International Center of Photography in New York where she is working on her new multimedia project to raise awareness about nature. Currently she is a participant in the 3-month artist Residency from EV_Largo “Possible Futures” 2020. </p>
